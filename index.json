The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) required a data sharing statement (DSS) from submissions reporting clinical trials effective July 1, 2018. The required DSSs provide a window into current data sharing rates, practices, and norms among trialists and sponsors.\n\n**Objective**  To evaluate the implementation of the ICMJE DSS requirement in 3 leading medical journals: JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This is a cross-sectional study of clinical trial reports published as articles in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM between July 1, 2018, and April 4, 2020. Articles not eligible for DSS, including observational studies and letters or correspondence, were excluded. A MEDLINE/PubMed search identified 487 eligible clinical trials in JAMA (112 trials), Lancet (147 trials), and NEJM (228 trials). Two reviewers evaluated each of the 487 articles independently.\n\n**Exposure**  Publication of clinical trial reports in an ICMJE medical journal requiring a DSS.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures**  The primary outcomes of the study were declared data availability and actual data availability in repositories. Other captured outcomes were data type, access, and conditions and reasons for data availability or unavailability. Associations with funding sources were examined.\n\n**Results**  A total of 334 of 487 articles (68.6%; 95% CI, 64%-73%) declared data sharing, with nonindustry NIH-funded trials exhibiting the highest rates of declared data sharing (89%; 95% CI, 80%-98%) and industry-funded trials the lowest (61%; 95% CI, 54%-68%). However, only 2 IPD sets (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.0%-1.5%) were actually deidentified and publicly available as of April 10, 2020. The remaining were supposedly accessible via request to authors (143 of 334 articles [42.8%]), repository (89 of 334 articles [26.6%]), and company (78 of 334 articles [23.4%]). Among the 89 articles declaring that IPD would be stored in repositories, only 17 (19.1%) deposited data, mostly because of embargo and regulatory approval. Embargo was set in 47.3% of data-sharing articles (158 of 334), and in half of them the period exceeded 1 year or was unspecified.\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance**  Most trials published in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM after the implementation of the ICMJE policy declared their intent to make clinical data available. However, a wide gap between declared and actual data sharing exists. To improve transparency and data reuse, journals should promote the use of unique pointers to data set location and standardized choices for embargo periods and access requirements.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation of Data Sharing After Implementation of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Data Sharing Statement Requirement","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599684881,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599684881,"objectID":"b3857f7c5a07f65e2830d64ad88610f2","permalink":"https://valdanchev.github.io/talk/data-sharing-rct/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T21:54:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/data-sharing-rct/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation of Clinical Trial Data Sharing Policy in Leading Medical Journals (Poster)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Valentin Danchev","Mason A.

In this chapter, we first review advances in the study of migration networks and recent work that has employed network analysis to examine such networks at different geographical scales. In our discussion, we focus in particular on global-scale migration networks. We then propose ways to leverage network analysis in concert with digital technologies and online geolocated data to examine the structure and dynamics of migration networks. The implementation of such approaches for studying migration networks faces many challenges, including ethical ones, methodological ones, socio-technological ones (e.g., data availability and reuse), and research reproducibility. We detail these challenges, and we then consider possible ways of linking digital geolocated data to administrative and survey data as a way of harnessing new technologies to construct increasingly realistic migration networks (e.g., using multiplex networks). We also briefly discuss new methods (e.g., multilayer network analysis) in network analysis and adjacent fields (e.g., machine learning) that can help advance understanding of macroscale patterns of migration.","tags":[],"title":"Migration Networks: Applications of Network Analysis to Macroscale Migration Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom E.

Meta-research, or research-on-research, is a burgeoning discipline that investigates efficiency, quality, and bias in the scientific ecosystem, topics that have become especially relevant amid widespread concerns about the credibility of the scientific literature. Meta-research may help calibrate the scientific ecosystem toward higher standards by providing empirical evidence that informs the iterative generation and refinement of reform initiatives. We introduce a translational framework that involves (a) identifying problems, (b) investigating problems, (c) developing solutions, and (d) evaluating solutions. In each of these areas, we review key meta-research endeavors and discuss several examples of prior and ongoing work. The scientific ecosystem is perpetually evolving; the discipline of meta-research presents an opportunity to use empirical evidence to guide its development and maximize its potential.","tags":[],"title":"Calibrating the Scientific Ecosystem Through Meta-Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575665051,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575665051,"objectID":"734ee4e4b7a19825158afd4f592afdbd","permalink":"https://valdanchev.github.io/talk/prism/","publishdate":"2019-12-06T21:44:11+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/prism/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multiplex Social Media Networks: Addressing Vaping (Mis)information and Prevention","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Valentin Danchev","Andrey Rzhetsky","James A Evans"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562082204,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562082204,"objectID":"46467655457844a09a37fe31b88591d3","permalink":"https://valdanchev.github.io/publication/centralized-communities/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T16:43:24+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/centralized-communities/","section":"publication","summary":"Concerns have been expressed about the robustness of experimental findings in several areas of science, but these matters have not been evaluated at scale. Here we identify a large sample of published drug-gene interaction claims curated in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (for example, benzo(a)pyrene decreases expression of SLC22A3) and evaluate these claims by connecting them with high-throughput experiments from the LINCS L1000 program. Our sample included 60,159 supporting findings and 4253 opposing findings about 51,292 drug-gene interaction claims in 3363 scientific articles. We show that claims reported in a single paper replicate 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9‚Äì21.2%) more frequently than expected, while claims reported in multiple papers replicate 45.5% (95% CI, 21.8‚Äì74.2%) more frequently than expected. We also analyze the subsample of interactions with two or more published findings (2493 claims; 6272 supporting findings; 339 opposing findings; 1282 research articles), and show that centralized scientific communities, which use similar methods and involve shared authors who contribute to many articles, propagate less replicable claims than decentralized communities, which use more diverse methods and contain more independent teams. Our findings suggest how policies that foster decentralized collaboration will increase the robustness of scientific findings in biomedical research.","tags":[],"title":"Centralized scientific communities are less likely to generate replicable results","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin Danchev","Mason A.

However, since the late 1970s, many scholars have argued that movements reach beyond contiguous regions to connect distant, dispersed, and previously disconnected countries across the globe. The precise structure of world migration, however, remains an open question. We apply network analysis that incorporates spatial information to international migration-stock data to examine what multilateral structures of world migration have emerged from the interplay of regional concentration (local cohesion) and global interconnectedness (global cohesion) for the period 1960‚Äì2000. In the world migration net- work (WMN), nodes represent countries located in geographic space, and edges represent migrants from an origin country who live in a destination country during each decade. We characterize the large-scale structure and evolution of the WMN by algorithmically detecting international migration communities (i.e., sets of countries that are densely connected via migration) using a generalized modularity function for spatial, temporal, and directed networks. Our findings for the whole network suggest that move- ments in the WMN deviate significantly from the regional boundaries of the world and that international migration communities have become globally interconnected over time. However, we observe a strong variability in the distribution of strengths, neighborhood overlaps, and lengths of migration edges in the WMN. This manifests as three types of communities: global, local, and glocal. We find that long-distance movements in global communities bridge multiple non-contiguous countries, whereas local (and, to a lesser extent, glocal) communities remain trapped in contiguous geographic regions (or neighboring regions) for almost the whole period, contributing to a spatially fragmented WMN. Our findings demon- strate that world migration is neither regionally concentrated nor globally interconnected, but instead exhibits a heterogeneous connectivity pattern that channels unequal migration opportunities across the world.","tags":[],"title":"Neither global nor local: Heterogeneous connectivity in spatial network structures of world migration","type":"publication"}]
