**[11 Nov 2021]** &nbsp; I was invited to give a talk at the [2022 Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility (2022 TWR)](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/event/2022-toronto-workshop-on-reproducibility/) hosted by the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute (CANSSI) Ontario and the Data Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto, 23–25 February, 2022.
**[28 Oct 2021]** &nbsp; I organised and participated in a multidisciplinary workshop panel [Building Responsible Data Science Workflows: Transparency, Reproducibility, and Ethics by Design](https://pydata.org/global2021/schedule/presentation/130/transparent-responsible-and-trustworthy-data-science-workflows/) at the [PyData Global 2021 conference](https://pydata.org/global2021/), 28–30 October 2021.
**[25 Oct 2021]** &nbsp; I am a co-author on [Naudet _et al._ Medical journal requirements for clinical trial data sharing: Ripe for improvement](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003844), published in PLOS Medicine.
**[3 Sep 2021]** &nbsp; I am invited faculty at the [Research Transparency and Reproducibility Training (RT2)](https://www.bitss.org/events/rt2virtual2021/), August 23–September 3, 2021, organised by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences. With teaching assistant Hamid Nejadghorban (PhD candidate in Economics, University of Essex), we provided a hands-on tutorial on [Dynamic Documents with Jupyter Notebook for Reproducible Workflows](https://github.com/valdanchev/dynamic-documents-with-jupyter-notebook). Materials and computer code from the training and our session are publicly available on [OSF](https://osf.io/tdhck/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/valdanchev/dynamic-documents-with-jupyter-notebook) repositories.
**[16 Jun 2021]** &nbsp; I gave a talk about my open learning resource [Reproducible Data Science](https://valdanchev.github.io/reproducible-data-science-python/intro.html) at the [2021 National Workshop on Data Science Education](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/data-science-education-resources/2021-national-workshop-data-science-education), 14–18 June 2021, organised by UC Berkeley's Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society.
**[9 Jun 2021]**  &nbsp; My learning resource [Reproducible Data Science with Open-Source Python Tools and Real-World Data](https://valdanchev.github.io/reproducible-data-science-python/intro.html) is available open access under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
